My name is Guokan Shang (尚国侃 in Chinese), here is my [Curriculum Vitae](CV_Guokan_Shang.pdf), you can find my contact at the footer of this website.

Currently, I am a Lead Research Scientist at [MBZUAI France Lab](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/llm/){:target="_blank"}, a new AI research center in Paris affiliated with the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) headquartered in Abu Dhabi. This lab, with a vision for leading-edge AI innovation, focusing on R&D within Generative AI and Large Language Models. <br>
I also hold a part-time teaching position (Chargé d'Enseignement) at the computer science departement of École Polytechnique. <br>

My research interests span all aspects of machine learning, and particularly its applications to natural language processing (NLP). My recent work mainly focused on challenging tasks such as meeting summarization, dialogue understanding, and NLG evaluation metrics. I am currently working on large language models (LLMs), and their applications to dialogue domain.

Funded by French CIFRE Ph.D. fellowship, I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from École Polytechnique under the supervision of Prof. [Michalis Vazirgiannis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aWGJYcMAAAAJ){:target="_blank"} at the [DaSciM team](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/){:target="_blank"}, with which I maintain a research collaboration till today. <br>
