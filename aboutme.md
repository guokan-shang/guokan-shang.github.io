My name is Guokan Shang (尚国侃).

I am a research scientist at LINAGORA, a French leader in open-source software ecosystem. Within the [Labs team](https://labs.linagora.com), we are building AI-powered collaborative platforms with the aim of facilitating communication and personal interaction in a corporate environment.

My research interests span all aspects of machine learning and its applications to natural language processing, more specifically Spoken Language Understanding / NLP for conversations / Conversational AI / Dialogue and Interactive Systems. My recent work mainly focused on challenging tasks such as abstractive meeting summarization and NLG evaluation.

I received my Ph.D. in 2021 from Ecole Polytechnique and obtained a Master's degree in 2016 from Paris-Saclay University, both in Machine Learning. Before that, I obtained an Engineer's degree in 2015 from University of Technology of Troyes and a Bachelor's degree in 2013 from Harbin Institute of Technology, both in Computer Science.

I am always looking for professionals with mutual interests to learn and share experiences, so feel free to contact me! look at the footer of this website for your preferred method.
