This is the code for my personal website, based on the [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) template,  
I also activated the [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plug-in for bibliography management (reference and citation), with the great help of [this blog post](https://open-research.gemmadanks.com/tutorials/how-to-use-jekyll-scholar-with-github-pages/).
