Here is the code for my personal website / blog, based on the [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) template.

I also installed the plug-ins in below:
- [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) for bibliography management (reference and citation), with the great help of [this blog post](https://open-research.gemmadanks.com/tutorials/how-to-use-jekyll-scholar-with-github-pages/).
- [jekyll-post-image-generator](https://github.com/guokan-shang/jekyll-post-image-generator) for automatically generating images for the [link previews](https://www.opengraph.xyz/) when shared on social medias, dependencies need to be installed with [GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/guokan-shang/guokan-shang.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml#L34).
